            <h1>2024 Mock Draft 1.0</h1>
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>1. Panthers - James Pearce Jr (EDGE Tennessee - 6-5 242)</h2>
                <p>Carolina needs help everywhere. I think tackle is probably the most glaring need, especially if former 6th overall pick Icky Ekwonu doesn’t pan out. In this draft, they take Tennessee EDGE James Pearce Jr. It’s impossible to watch Tennessee and not have your eyes constantly pulled to #27. 6-5 242. Still a bit lean and growing into his body. Looks to have elite length. Good bend. Great power for someone who needs to bulk up 10 more pounds. This guy is just starting to scratch the surface of potential. 10+ sacks in the SEC as a true sophomore. It’s hard not to see Pearce Jr where he is now, with those traits, and not project perennial pro bowler.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>2. Patriots - Kelvin Banks Jr (OT Texas - 6-4 324)</h2>
                <p>By far my favorite OT in this draft so far. Banks has been starting since his true freshman year. 6-4 324. If I had to guess, I’d say around 34 inch arms which would be good length. Light feet. Had 12 big time blocks last year. He has the ability to completely eliminate people on the move and has bad intentions. I wish Banks was a little more technically polished overall for someone who has started 2 full seasons before their junior year. His pass protection can still be sloppy. Often has wide hands with sloppy hand placement. I think playing in the BIG 12 has definitely hurt Banks as a prospect. He hardly was ever challenged and could win consistently with just his physical and athletic gifts. Playing in the SEC this season will be so important for his development. But he checks all the boxes for an impact OT at the next level. Long. Powerful. Light feet. Aggressive. The Patriots have arguably the worst offensive tackles in the league and Drake Maye will need help. Banks Jr is the only OT right now I would draft in the first 10-15 picks of the 2025 draft.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>3. Broncos - Luther Burden III (WR Missouri - 5-11 208)</h2>
                <p>Denver needs playmakers on the outside for Bo Nix. Burden is the perfect fit for Sean Payton’s quick hitting offense. 5-11 208. Burden has crazy explosiveness, toughness and YAC. His highlight tape is impressive. Impossible to arm tackle, his change of direction and contact balance are elite. Still working on the nuances of route running, but he’s shown he can be a deep threat as well as a short yardage YAC king. Burden III has the potential to be game changer at the next level. He is the only WR I have a true 1st round grade on right now in the class.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>4. Commanders - Will Campbell (OT LSU - 6-6 320)</h2>
                <p>The media is exceptionally high on Will Campbell. He’s consistently mocked and talked about as a sure-fire top 5-10 pick. 6-6 320. Rumored to have sub - 33 inch arms. Campbell's strengths are his technique. He has the Peter Skoronski-esque tape. Every rep looks the same. It gets almost boring to watch. He understands the position, angles and strike timing. He has good displacement in the run game. But damn, his size profile scares me. He has the tall OT problem, where he’s so tall but has well below average arm length that makes matchups with longer edge defenders incredibly difficult as they can establish first meaningful contact consistently and win the natural leverage battle. Campbell struggled against some of the NFL caliber pass rushers he faced like Jared Verse. Verse took his lunch money and won with power through his chest. Rashawn Slater is one of the only starting OTs in the league with 33 inch or less arms (The only others being the two Colts OTs Braden Smith and Bernhard Raiimann). But Slater had special core strength and technique coming out of college. It’s not that I think Campbell will be a bad player, I just think he lacks the special traits required to be even be one of the better OTs in the league. And I wouldn’t draft that in the top 10.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>5. Titans - Nic Scourton (EDGE Texas A&M - 6-4 280)</h2>
                <p>Looking for fun tape? Scourton is physically impressive. 6-4 280 pounds. Seems to have good get off. Great size and power. Already has a nasty spin move. Scourton had 10 sacks for Purdue last year. He just transferred to Texas A&M so he will be seeing SEC competition now. Scourton checks the size, power, and athletic boxes. Seems to have good length. He’s still learning to iron out his pass rush plan. He shows burst coming out of a 2 point stance at 280 pounds which is rare. The Titans need to reload at EDGE for the future and Scourton can fit any scheme. I think Scourton has a chance to be a special EDGE player at the next level.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>6. Raiders - Shadeur Sanders (QB Colorado 6-2 210)</h2>
                <p>LV will be drafting QB in this draft. It won’t take many games in the 2024 season of Minshew/O’Connell for the fan base to turn and put huge pressure on the front office to draft someone. The issue is I don’t think there’s a single QB worthy of a 1st round selection heading into the 2024 season. But that never stops teams from picking them a round earlier than they should. Sanders 6-2 210. He does a lot of things well. Manages the game, doesn’t turn the ball over. Seems to have really good accuracy at all levels. But his arm strength is average at best, and he has a small frame. Add in the drama of the Sanders family and it’s not something I would want in the top 10. I think best case scenario, Sanders is a Teddy Bridgewater before the catastrophic knee injuries. And that’s still a huge upgrade over Gardner Minshew.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>7. Cardinals - Will Johnson (CB Michigan - 6’2 202)</h2>
                <p>Elite size for the position. I think Johnson is one of the top 3 players on this class. His change of direction for a 6’2 corner is crazy. He’s been guarding WR1s since his true freshmen year and considering he’s against Ohio State every year among others, that’s impressive. I worry a little about Johnson’s long speed against faster WRs but this cat is shutdown. It’s hard not envisioning him being at worst a decent starter and more likely  a constant pro bowler. He has the Patrick Surtain Jr build and play style. </p>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>8. Saints - Carson Beck (QB Georgia - 6-4 220)</h2>
                <p>New Orleans is always a tough team to mock for. Their drafting lately has been poor, and their constant philosophy of pushing dead cap into the future has caught up and will continue to catch up with them. With very little cap flexibility, their options are limited. Derek Carr is at least coming close to the end of his contract, and resetting the QB position is a must. Carson Beck has the highest floor of any of the QB prospects, but I don’t see much of a ceiling. Nothing is elite. He’s a sightly better Mac Jones/Kenny Pickett type prospect but that will be better than what they’ve had and a lot cheaper, giving them some cap relief they’ve needed for a long time. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>9. Vikings - Travis Hunter (CB Colorado - 6-1 185)</h2>
                <p>Travis Hunter is a special prospect. The only one I can remember that plays both ways in college. As a WR, I see a good player with good traits. As a CB, I see a potentially elite player with elite traits. His interceptions are better than any corner in the nation. Absurd zone anticipation. Crazy ball skills. The quickness of his processing the field and jumping routes is truly different. Playing both ways seems to make him gassed at the end of games, where you see him give up catches later in games. If he plays just CB, which I’m projecting, and can focus only on that, Hunter could become a rare difference maker on the outside. He needs to bulk up, and the lack of play strength shows up in his Stanford tape and in the run game. I see Hunter being a Trevon Diggs type prospect. Former WR that knows how the offense will attack him, understands route concepts, and will be consistently be able to take the ball away. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>10. Giants - Mason Graham (DT Michigan - 6-3 318)</h2>
                <p>Maybe the best player in the class. On a national championship winning defense, Graham was the player that stuck out - a rare feat for a defensive tackle. Graham checks every box besides length (rumored to be sub 33 inch arms). Size, power, athleticism, technique, awareness. Grahams ability to shed blocks and make plays is next to none in the class. Graham might measure in under 6-3, and given his below average arm length, I can see him slipping somewhere 6-10 rather than top 5 where he belongs. I actually think his relatively shorter stature helps him. Michigan played Graham everywhere from NOSE to 5-tech. He wins the natural leverage battle and his absurd athleticism makes him a handful to deal with inside. Pairing Mason Graham next to Dexter Lawrence just feels unfair. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>11. Seahawks - Abdul Carter (LB Penn State - 6’5 255)</h2>
                <p>Mike McDonald is coming over from Baltimore, bringing in his versatile attacking 3-4 defense. Carter has top 5-10 potential. He is one of the few players in the class I’ve watched and immediately thought to myself “this cat moves differently than everyone else.” Going to run in the 4.4s at almost 260 pounds. Carter had been playing off-ball linebacker for Penn St but is moving to EDGE full time this season. Penn State gave him #11, the first since Micah Parsons left there - a sign that they view Carted as a true leader and different maker. Carter right now is a ball of clay. Freak athlete, violent hitter. He has the tools to break out this year. He’s perfect for Mike Macdonald. They can line him up on the edge on passing downs. They can let him stand up over the center (like the Cowboys do with Parsons). They can even occasionally drop him into coverage where he also looks great. I think everyone will be talking about Carter come draft time next year after a big season on the edge. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>12. Buccaneers - Mykel Williams (EDGE Georgia - 6’5 265)</h2>
                <p>Williams is another EDGE player I see having a meteoric rise this season. Much like Travon Walker (who quietly had 10 sacks in his second year with the Jags), Williams played on a deep rotation on the Georgia line, and his stats don’t pop out. Asked to 2-gap, read/react and hold the edge, Georgia rarely lined up Williams outside the OT and let him use his crazy athletic tools and length to dominate. Williams is already solid against the run, and with his size, length, explosiveness, and power I can see a team taking him top 10 thinking we can improve his pass rush plan and make him a dominant 3-down player. Travon Walker went 1 a couple seasons ago, and with similar size/athletic/length profiles, I can see Williams as one of the biggest risers this season. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>13. Colts - Deone Walker (DT Kentucky - 6’6 350)</h2>
                <p>You might notice a pattern with the last few picks. Athletic freaks that are still learning the game + asked to do things that don’t always maximize their skill sets in college. Deone Walker is a rare prospect. With that size, he blocks out the sun. Kentucky lines him up from nose to edge and it’s impossible not to notice Walker on tape. He has arguably the best spin move I’ve ever seen a 350+ pounder use consistently. Walker has more of a finesse game to him, and given his absurd athleticism - that’s not necessarily a bad thing. He says he can run in the 4.6s, which would not only be the fastest ever for someone 6’6 350, but the fastest ever for any defensive tackle in NFL history. The issue with Walker, and why he’s not to pick 5-10, is how bad his pad level is consistently combined with an underdeveloped pass rush plan. Given his freakazoid size/length/explosiveness/power, we should see Walker bullying his opponents way more than you do. It’s like he’s playing a small man’s game. If he can show more power, I think you put him at nose, and let him dominate centers and guards. His length and power can set up his more finesse game like his spin move. I want to know about Deone Walker the person though. Does he love football? Will he keep his weight in check? Playing 350+ is a no go in the NFL long term. Can he play with better pad level and take to coaching? If yes Walker could easily be a top 10 pick next year after a season where he shows improvements in those areas in the SEC. </p>

            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>14. Steelers - Harold Perkins (ILB LSU - 6-0 220)</h2>
                <p>Pittsburgh is always looking for freaks at linebacker. Since losing Ryan Shazier, they’ve tried moving up in the draft for Devon Bush, which even though didn’t work out seemed like a good idea at the time. Perkins moves different. He ran a 4.36 for scouts this spring. His twitch pops on tape and Perkins has been a college household name since breaking out as a true freshmen. Even though Perkins best role in college has been on the edge, his size prevents him from doing that in the NFL. He’s going to weakside play off ball linebacker. He’s not big enough to play MIKE LB.  But his explosiveness and playmaking in pass defense make him highly coveted by teams. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>15. Jaguars - Tetairoa McMillan (WR Arizona - 6-5 215)</h2>
                <p>Jacksonville needs help on the outside. They drafted WR Brian Thomas Jr in the 1st this past season, but it’s not certain he’s their permanent X. I see him as their Z, with Christian Kirk in the slot. Doug Pederson had alot of success with the Eagles with Alshon Jeffrey. McMillan is even bigger than Jeffrey. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen someone with a consistent highlight reel catcher in college. Crazy hands. Decent speed for someone that big but I don’t think he’s running by DBs. He’s contested catch king and that’s exactly what Lawrence needs. A huge X that can you throw it anywhere in their radius and it’s there’s. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>16. Browns - Emeka Egbuka (WR Ohio State - 6-1 205)</h2>
                <p>Cleveland tried to trade for Brandon Aiyuk, but Aiyuk refused to sign long term with the browns which ended trade talks. Amari Cooper is still a good WR, but he’s on he wrong side of 30 and comes with a huge cap hit. Given Watsons fully guaranteed contract, Cleveland needs to high in cheap draft picks. Egbuka is going to be a solid (mostly slot) WR at the next level. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>17. Rams - Malaki Starks (S Georgia - 6-1 205)</h2>
                <p>Rams take best player available.  Starks has been a standout since his freshmen year. He is a true single high safety that still is excellent around the line of scrimmage. He moves like a corner, and I think he could play any position in the secondary, including outside corner. He has ball skills, instincts. With a little more polish he’s a sure fire top 15, which is rare for safeties. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>18. Bears - Tyleik Williams (DT Ohio State - 6-3 330)</h2>
                <p>Tyleik Williams is one of the one of the DTs I’m most intrigued to watch this year. Often rotated along a deep Buckeye line, with DT Michael Hall drafted this year, Williams could play even more snaps. Shows good first step and power. Needs a lot of work as a pass rusher but I think the floor is high with his run defense. His first step and power profile translate to someone that can rush on pass downs. The Bears need to get better in the middle of their d-line and Williams is an instant starter. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>19. Chargers - Colston Loveland (TE Michigan - 6-4 250)</h2>
                <p>Jim Harbaugh reunites with his former tight end on his championship Michigan team. Loveland brings physicality in the run game for a smaller tight end, but a developing route runner. I can see Loveland being a Sam LaPorta type prospect but better as a blocker. This well open the middle of the field and improve their run offense which is exactly what Harbaugh wants to establish. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>20. Falcons - Benjamin Morrison (CB Notre Dame - 5-11 200)</h2>
                <p>Morrison has some impressive tape, showing good athleticism and change of direction and sticky man coverage. His small frame hurts his run defense and he’s a liability in the run game. It’s why someone with his athletic profile is going here and not top 15. Can Morrison bulk up and get better in that area? If he does he can improve this projection.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>21. Cowboys - Kenneth Grant (DT Michigan - 6’3 340)</h2>
                <p>Dallas goes back to the Michigan well of DTs in hopes they finally solve their interior defensive line woes. Mazi Smith hasn’t developed into the type of nose tackle they hoped. But he’s still young and developing. I like Grant even more than Mazi Smith coming out. Watching Grant chase down the Penn State running back and seeing he reach over 15 MPH in a large handful of plays shows his effort is there and that athleticism is freakish for someone 340. Grant seems to have really good length, and with his crazy athletic profile combined with his massive size, I can see Grant establishing himself as a top 15 pick.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>22. Dolphins - Aireontae Ersery (OT Minnesota - 6-5 330)</h2>
                <p>Another large human that can move. Ersery looks surprisingly nimble for someone that big. Between the run heavy Minnesota Offense and his size/athletic combo, He was rarely challenged in true pass sets. But Ersery has the size, power and movement skills needed to succeed at the next level. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="draft-pick">
                <h2>23. Jets - Emery Jones Jr (RT LSU - 6-4 325)</h2>
                <p>Assuming Tyron Smith and Morgan Moses leave, or even if they stay one more season, the Jets need to address right tackle long term after drafting LT Olu Fashanu this year. Jones is a bully. While a bit shorter, he has rumored 34+ inch arms which is excellent for that height.he eliminates people in the run game and even in pass protection. I worry a bit about kick slide/foot speed - can he protect his outside edge on islands against the Garretts, Parsons, Bosa, Burns? But he checks every other box and I think with some good coaching, specifically being more patient/selective with his strikes and to keep moving his feet while doing so, he can become a sure fire 1st round pick.  He often stops his feet going for knockout punches which can be highlight reel worthy, but also a major liability in pass protection at times. With some technical polish, Jones has the traits - the biggest dynamite hands at tackle - to be a really good player at either RT or guard. AVT + Emery Jones on the right side would be one of the craziest run blocking units in the NFL. </p>

                <h2>24. Packers - Tyler Booker (OG Alabama - 6-5 340)</h2>
                <p>Booker is my favorite guard in the class and has an all pro ceiling. That size and power profile, combined with really good feet for someone that massive makes him a problem to deal with. I can see Booker going top 15 with a good season for Alabama. Green Bay gladly takes BPA and grabs the gifted young guard that fell because of his position. </p>
            
                <div class="draft-pick">
                    <h2>25. Texans - Tecario Davis (CB Arizona - 6-4 205)</h2>
                    <p>Davis brings eye popping size for a corner. I think his change of direction is good for someone that big but not elite for corner so that could make him more scheme specific. The Texans want to get at after it with the front 4 and play zone behind it. Davis can be an elite cover 3 corner in this scheme across from CB Derek Stingley Jr. </p>
                </div>

                    <p>The Eagles always reload in the trenches and plan for the future. I think Savaiinaea paired with Dickerson give them an imposing guard duo and make life easier for first year starter C Cam Jurgens as they try and replace hall of fame bound C Jason Kelce. I love Savaiinaea and think he has the feet to play RT but I think his movement skills and lack of length make him a pro bowl level guard prospect. </p>

                    <p>The WR with arguably the greatest speed in the draft, Bond has shown enough ball skills and nuance to believe he can be more than a burner. He needs to master throttling up and down his electric 4.3s speed but I don’t see the NFL letting that get out of the 1st round. I don’t see Cincinnati paying both Higgins and Chase long term. Show me a championship team that was paying two 30+ million WRs and a $50 million dollar QB. They need to get cheaper at an important position and Bond gives them juice they don’t have.  </p>

                    <p> Buffalo is always trying to solve EDGE after repeated top 100 selection. With Von Miller coming to his probable last season, and no true difference maker behind him, the Bills go Umanmielen. He has the size, athleticism and explosion, and bend to be a good rusher at the next level. He needs to be more consistent and sharpen that pass rush plan but Umanmielen could be in store for a big rise his senior year after transferring to Ole Miss. </p>

                    <h2>29. Lions - Connor Weigman (QB Texas A&M - 6-3 215)</h2>
                    <p>Maybe the first shock of the draft. The Lions have been a really good team with Jared Goff. But he caps their ceiling. He isn’t going to win a game against Mahomes, Allen or Lamar in a shootout in the playoffs. He is a turnover waiting to happen at the most important times in games. I’m projecting here - Weigmann only played 4 games last season before getting hurt. A former baseball player, he can change arm slots/throws off platform, and shows crazy arm talent. He has the traits of a 1st round QB if he can play a full season and show improvements in processing. He’s so young, that he could theoretically sit behind Goff for multiple seasons if they </p>

                    <h2>30. Ravens - Patrick Payton (EDGE Florida State - 6-5 250)</h2>
                    <p>Baltimore also goes BPA every draft and it’s why they’ve been competitive for 25+ years. It’s how Kyle Hamilton and Tyler Linderbaum became Ravens. Payton requires some projecting. He certainly isn’t there as a pass rusher. But he’s got the size, length and athleticism to be a versatile 3-4 backer. He deflects a ton of balls, and can even drop into coverage. He’s perfect for the Ravens 3-4 defense and with some polish could also become an impact edge rusher. </p>

                    <h2>31. 49ers - Shemar Turner (DT Texas A&M - 6-4 290)</h2>
                    <p> He’s the ideal 4-3 defense 3-tech, although those lines are very blurred in todays hybrid fronts.  He’s an absolute freakazoid of an athlete. He’s learning the position, as he’s played everything from EDGE to nose tackle. Turner needs a ton of polish as a pass rusher , but he checks all the boxes of being a very disruptive interior rusher. </p>

                    <h2>32. Chiefs - Blake Miller (RT Clemson 6-6 300?)</h2>
                    <p>One of the surprise “my guys” early in the draft. On tape Miller looks about 6-6 and 300 at most on tape. He’s listed at 310 but I’ve heard he was actually playing at 295. That won’t last in the NFL. He needs to put on at least 15-20 pounds. I normally don’t fall for the guys that lack good play strength. But Miller has the frame and the age (true junior) to bulk up over the next couple seasons. He has some of the best feet of the tackle class matched with seemingly decent length (34 inch?)that lets him mirrors rushers so well. I think he will be one of the best pass protecting right tackles in the class especially if he gets stronger and improves play strength. Miller is a perfect fit for a west coast/zone run schemes. The chiefs can get younger and cheaper at one of the most important positions by going Miller here.  </p>
